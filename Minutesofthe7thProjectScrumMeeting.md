**2.   Discussion of impediments and resolution**

Ho Kin Long discovered the problems about the efficiency and accuracy of importing events from Google Calendar. It is expected that users can synchronize faster when they chose to import events from a period of days than that from all days. However, the result is that both of them are using a similar amount of time.

Second, after deleting an event from the app, it is difficult to identify the corresponding event in Google Calendar. A possible solution is to delete all events from Google Calendar and upload the events from the database of the apps.

Wong Kwok Wai researched the method of identifying which website have been browsed. It can be implemented by viewing the cookies.
As browsing a website may requested many information from diffenert IP addresses, we may need to duel with similarity of addresses and thus prevent redundant identification.

Hon Kwun Wing discussed about the integration of different modules to make a prototype. We decided move this part to sunday to allow more time to refine our code before integration.


**3.   Goals for the coming week**
