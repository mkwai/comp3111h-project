**2.   Discussion of impediments and resolution**


Wong Kwok Wai has tried to developed the location-based function and implement the GPS but he does not have an Android phone so that it is very inconvenient for him to test the program. Therefore, he tested with Cheuk Hoi Yanâ€™s phone during the meeting and we borrowed another Android phone for developing our project.

Wong Kwok Wai tested the GPS and found that the location indicated was wrong. He hence found another library.

Chan Kai Ho could not fully understand how to develop a calendar interface, such as whether each day should be an object or stored in array. He will try to look at the existing android calendar app in the coming week.
