## Project Description ##

Our project is to make an Android app which aims to assist people daily lives, especially focus on time, task and gathering management. The basic features are weekly and daily timetable and to-do list. Moreover, HKUST timetable could be imported to individuals’ schedule. There are some special functions which are less-frequently seen in the market. One of them is the function of blocking other apps such as “facebook” and “twitter” for a customized time period so that users can be more concentrated on their other work during that period. Assisting users to get friends’ timetables and finding common free time is another useful function for social interaction. One more innovative function is a location-based event reminder, which reminds user to leave a place and arrives next destination on time.

## Our Motivation ##

Nowadays, people lives have become more and more busy. Especially for Hong Kong people, daily life is always fully-packed with many different tasks and events. It is not uncommon to see that students work overnight for meeting assignment deadlines or multitask for four or even more tasks at the same time. Many people find it is difficult to strike a balance between different aspects in their lives, work, relationship, leisure, etc.

Furthermore, the interaction and cooperation between people has been greatly increased. For example, students are required to be continuously involved in group works for both academic projects and extracurricular activities in university and after graduation. This makes time management becomes even more complicated because one has to take others’ time schedule into consideration also.

In order to handle the job deadlines and leisure time, as well as social gathering, a helpful and portable smart phone app would be a great solution to everyday time management problem people facing. However, there is lacking time-related app with comprehensive features in market now. In view of this, the project of DailyAssistant is suggested to be conducted, helping Android mobile users more effectively and efficiently using their daily time and manage tasks. It could reduce busy people’s pressure and eventually lead to an increase of overall quality of life.

## Development Tools ##

The app will be designed and made by using the following tools:

●	Eclipse 3.7

●	Java SDK

●	Android SDK platform 2.2 (tentative)

●	MySQL database server

●	Subversion

# Project Management Plan #
## Project Development ##
In developing our app, we are going to use scrum software development process.
## Division of Labor ##

The software will be divided into separate parts and each member is responsible for different parts. Group leader will be responsible to make sure that all group members are carrying out their assigned duties on time, collect all codes and connect them. He is the one who should know the whole picture, keeping track the progress of each task but not necessary how every parts of code works. Other group members could be concentrated on their own part.

## Communication ##

In every week, at least one meeting will be hold to update each other’s progress. This provides a platform for members to share their difficulties facing on their part and discuss those problems together regularly. Our group might work together in computer laboratory also, having pair programming. This can improve our communication and learn from each other, exchanging ideas.
