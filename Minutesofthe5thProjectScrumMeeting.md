**2.   Discussion of impediments and resolution**

Chan Kai Ho raised up the problem of how to implement the daily schedule view, either using table or imageview. After disussion, we decided to use imageview as it would be more convenient to load a new event from database and display it in the daily schedule after the user added an event.

Ho Kin Long asked that if we can use the existing .jar in our project. We tried to export our app to .apk format and tested it in Cheuk Hoi Yanâ€™s phone. However, it did not work during the meeting. After that, we found that this is due to the Android version of her phone, which is Android 2.3.5. We actually required Android 4.0.3 to compile it. Chan Kai Ho then tested it using another Android phone after the meeting and it did work.
