**2.   Discussion of impediments and resolution**

We got several impediments during writing the domain modelling and use case modelling. Ho Kwun Wing showed his first draft of the modelling in the meeting and asked that whether the connection between classes is correct or not. Everybody discussed together and revised it.

Also, Wong Kwok Wai raised out the question that what user would used DailyAssistant. After discussion, we decided  to separate the user of our app into two groups, those who with and  without Internet connection. Hence, we revised it to have inheritance.
