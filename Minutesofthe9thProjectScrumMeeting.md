**2.   Discussion of impediments and resolution**

Testing the app on the computer is always slow. Moreover, sometimes it cannot work properly for unknown reason. However, we do not have a suitable Android phone to test on the program. It is very inconvenient for demonstration and testing. Therefore, we decided to try to downgrade the app or upgrade Cheuk Hoi Yanâ€™s Android phone in order to have real device testing.
