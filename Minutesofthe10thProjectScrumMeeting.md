**2.   Discussion of impediments and resolution**

Chan Kai Ho and Cheuk Hoi Yan tested the app in real machines and found that the login facebook account function cannot work in real machines even though it works successfully in virtual computer machines. Therefore, Hon Kwun Wing is asked to try to fix the problem.

Chan Kai Ho found difficulties to downgrade the calendar function in the app since the original calendar view need API 15 to implement it. Finally, he built up another calendar to replace the existing one. The problem was solved and the app was downgraded to version 2.3.3 successfully.
