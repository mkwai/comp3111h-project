**Recommendation:**

1. In the test case of Location Search, alert message should be given if no result was found.

2. Whenever network connection is needed, connectivity should be checked.

3. Test cases can be more critical in order to discover problem.

4. We should try to lower the version of Android needed to 2.3.3 instead of 4.0.3, for easier debugging, as well as allow more people to install and use.

_These recommendations are going to discuss in the next meeting._
