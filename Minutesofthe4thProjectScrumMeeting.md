**2.   Discussion of impediments and resolution**


Wong Kwok Wai had difficulties in getting duration time from google map . Then, we decided to seek advice from teacher assistant because this is a very important function of DailyAssistant. At last, the teacher assistant helped him to find a useful reference website which has code to inquire google maps for directions from an address to another one.

Hon Kwun Wing discussed the issue of security on remote server with facebook account. Then, we considered using more complicated data encryption method to solve it.
