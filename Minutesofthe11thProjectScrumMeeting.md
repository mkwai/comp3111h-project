**2.   Discussion of impediments and resolution**

For the synchronization with Google calendar function, the test cases passed in virtual device but not the real device. We discussed this problem but still have not found the reason yet. Ho Kin Long suggested that we can try to add a button “refresh” in the daily schedule page. After synchronizing with Google, we can check whether the timetable will be updated by clicking the refresh button.

Chan Kai Ho suggested that it is better to list out the blocked websites added by user. This will be more clear. Others all agreed with this suggestion. Therefore, Wong Kwok Wai is going to revised this function.
