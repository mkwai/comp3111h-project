**2.   Discussion of impediments and resolution**

We discussed about the content of our coming inner test (checking point 1). As it has to be included about 20%-60% of our whole app, we decided to cover those features that was demonstrated in the lab session, including calendar, timetable, location-based function, social sharing system, to-do list, synchronization with google calendar.

We found that the button “Refresh” in the sharing page has many different usage, which may confuse user. Therefore, we decided to ask Hon Kwun Wing to revise the interface of the sharing page.
