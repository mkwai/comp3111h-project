**2.   Discussion of impediments and resolution**


Wong Kwok Wai could not successfully find related reference code to block specific websites so he raised out that we might be unable to implement this function. After discussion, we decided to hinder the usage of websites by popping out warning message box whenever the user refresh or load the pages instead of blocking the IP address.

Ho Kin Long had difficulties in searching the method to import HKUST timetable. He found that maybe we cannot implement this function. He also mentioned it seems to be more convenient and easy to only make use of online google calendar. After discussing the pros and cons in both programmer and user views, we decided to change the function to allowing sychronization between the calendar in phone and online google calendar.
