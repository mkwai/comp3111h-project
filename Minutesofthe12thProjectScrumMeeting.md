**2.   Discussion of impediments and resolution**

Wong Kwok Wai asked if we can put our app to the android market or not. We think that it is possible, but some functions need to be suspend. For instance, the server used for storing facebook account information may not be good enough to support many users at a time and the security issue. Therefore, we may need to remove the sharing system beforehand. Wong Kwok Wai will be in charge of this.

Besides, we also discussed the arrangement of the second peer acceptance testing. Again, we divided our group into two teams, with Ho Kin Long and Wong Kwok Wai responsible for designing test cases for the opponent groupâ€™s app and Chan Kai Ho and Hon Kwun Wing will see if any other bug exists in our app.
